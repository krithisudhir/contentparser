A loser is having a hard time picking up chicks, 
so his well traveled friend takes him to a nightclub in Daytona where he tells him that he will score for sure. 
The loser enters the bar, sees his prey, and begins to barrage her with pick up lines that he acquired from his friend. 
The young lady continues to ignore him but finally gives in. 
She says " OK, I'll spend the night with you, but I've got to let you know up front that I'm on my menstrual cycle. 
The loser looks at her and says " That's OK. I'll follow you on my Moped.
