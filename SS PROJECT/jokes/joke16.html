There was this couple who took their son on a camping trip and in the room they were staying in, 
there was only one bunk bed. So the couple decided to lay on the top bunk 
and when they were about to have sex they made up code words for faster and slower. 
Faster was lettuce and slower was tomato. 
When the son asked what they were doing, they told him they were making a salad. 
The little boy then replied "Well could u be more careful because your spillin salad dressing on my face"
