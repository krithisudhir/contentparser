I got a phone call from a gorgeous ex-girlfriend of mine the other day. We 
lost track of time, chatting about the wild nights we used to enjoy 
together. I couldn't believe it when she asked if I'd like to meet up and 
maybe rekindle a little of that magic. 
"Wow!", I said, "I don't know if I could keep pace with you now! I'm a bit older and a bit balder than when you last saw me!" 
She giggled and said she was sure I'd meet the challenge! 
"Yeah", I said, "just so long as you don't mind a man with a waistband that's a few inches wider these days!" 
She laughed and told me to stop being so silly! She teased me, saying that she thought tubby bald men were cute! 
"Anyway, I've put on a couple of pounds myself!" she giggled 
.....so I told her to fuck off.
