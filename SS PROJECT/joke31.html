A man hired a lawyer when he got sued by his company for embezzlement of many millions. 
At the beginning of the process, 
the lawyer kindly reassured him: "Don’t worry, you’ll never go to jail with that amount of money."
And the lawyer was right. When the man did go to jail eventually, he didn’t have a penny anymore.
