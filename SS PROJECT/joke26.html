"Girl, this isnt a beer belly, its a fuel tank for my love machine!

Here is $30. Drink until I am really good looking, then come to talk to me. 

Your one tall glass of Labatts Blue and I'm real thirsty.

Girl, I would buy you a drink but I'd be jealous of the glass.

"Baby, you put the 'hot ass' in my shot glass.

I'm not drunk, I'm just intoxicated by you. 

(After spilling a beer on a pretty lady) Did you just take a shower or is it me that's making you wet? 

Hey, you owe me a drink. I dropped mine when you walked past.
