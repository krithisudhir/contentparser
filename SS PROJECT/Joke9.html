Three men went Las Vegas and after a losing their money at the blackjack tables, 
the best friends decided to stay off the strip in a not so lavish hotel and the guy that owned it had 18 daughters 
so the first man went up to they're father and said "can I sleep with your 18 daughters?" the father said "no but you can sleep with the pigs."
 the second man went to the father and said "can I sleep with your 18 daughters?" the father said " no but you can sleep with the cows." 
 the third man said "can I sleep with your 18 daughters?" the father said "yes." so in the morning the three men and the father had a conversation 
 over breakfast the first man said "I slept like a pig" the second man said "I slept like a cow" the third man said "I felt like a golfer" the father asked why? 
 he said cause I got my balls in 18 holes.
