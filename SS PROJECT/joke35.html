A couple had been debating the purchase of a new auto for weeks. 
He wanted a new truck. 
She wanted a fast little sports-like car so she could zip through traffic around town.
He would probably have settled on any beat up old truck, but everything she seemed to like was way out of their price range.
"Look!" she said. "I want something that goes from 0 to 200 in 4 seconds or less.
And my birthday is coming up. You could surprise me."
So, for her birthday, he bought her a brand new bathroom scale.
