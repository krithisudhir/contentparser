A police officer stops on the highway when he sees a guy tied up to a tree, crying. 
The officer stops and approaches the guy. "What's going on here?", he asks. 
The guy sobs, "I was driving and picked up a hitchhiker. 
He pulled a gun on me, robbed me, took all my money, my clothes, my car and then tied me up." 
The cop studied the guy for a moment, and then pulled down his pants and whipped out his dick. 
"I guess this isn't your lucky day, pal!"
